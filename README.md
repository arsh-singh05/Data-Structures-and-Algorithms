# Data-Structures-and-Algorithms

This repository contains a collection of data structures and algorithms implemented in Java and C++. The implementations include common data structures such as linked lists, stacks, queues, trees, and hash tables, as well as algorithms for sorting, searching, and graph traversal.

It mainly has all my second year Data Structures and Algorithms codes at BITS Pilani.

If you have any suggestions or improvements for the projects and exercises in this repository, feel free to create a pull request or open an issue. Contributions are welcome!
